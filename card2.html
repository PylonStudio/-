                <strong>A Viral Moment Turned Tragic</strong> <br><br>
                
                The man, whose identity remains undisclosed, pulled up to a local eatery intending to place an order.
                 However, to the shock of the cashier, he was visibly gooning. The employee, bewildered and shocked
                 , recorded the encounter and uploaded it online. The footage spread rapidly, quickly 
                 becoming viral on social media.<br><br>
                 What started out as a viral video ended in tragedy. It was later discovered that the man was no longer with us as a result of the incident, 
                 sending shockwaves through the community. 
                
                 <br><br><strong>'I can't goon!'</strong> <br><br>

                 Grief and anger soon transformed into a movement. Protestors took to the streets chanting "I can't goon!".
                 Demonstrators gathered outside the establishment where the incident occurred, livestreaming the event, sharing their thoughts and even confronting employees. <br><br>

                <strong>Ghost of the Goon</strong> <br><br>
                In the aftermath, a new phrase took hold in the public consciousness: "Ghost of the Goon". This is attributed to the 
                distinct car the man once drove. Reports have surfaced that the 'Ghost of the Goon' has been spotted all over the world followed by the yelling out of the infamous phrase.<br><br>
